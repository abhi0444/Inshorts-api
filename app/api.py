The following api pulls the news from Inshorts and returns it as a dictionary.
The dicitionary then can be used as per the need of the program. The functionality
is achieved by scraping the data from the website. Anyone using this API should first
obtain all the necessary permission from Inshorts before scraping the data and using
it for any commercial purpose.


Also the following API is completely dependant on the HTML structure of the website
thus any change to that will cause this API to fail (A sample for current structure
is given below thus if using this API one must make sure that the HTML structure for
the time is same on which this was dsigned).

    1. fetch_all(url, category)
    2. fetch_category(category)
